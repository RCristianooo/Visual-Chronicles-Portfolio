# Visual Chronicles Portfolio 
Visual Chronicles is a Portfolio made for Zephyr Stonefield, a photographer from Florida. I created his website in order to assist him in showcasing some of his photography to some of his clients. It is also considered to be center for anyone interesting in his work as well as a way to get in touch with Zephyr.

Visual Chronicles is the name of his freelancing business. As the single owner of Visual Chronicles, he sees his business as a project of his own. Taking pictures wherever he goes, often what he views to be magnificent in his own eyes. With photography being the center of his freelancing, his portfolio should be showing the images he has taken and nothing else. Therefore, Zephyr had a simple design in mind. He wanted a simple monochromatic colorway of blue. After a few suggestions, we went foward with a blue, a darker shade of blue, and black. He then only wanted a single section on the right that included the name of business, his name, social links, and finally many of his images. According to his instructions, the images in that section needed to be "smaller and clickable as if they were thumbnails on YouTube". The premise of his portfolio should be his pictures, therefore, when entered into the site, a person is introduced to his first image as ultimate showcasing. There is also an option to X out the section to enter fullscreen to his picture. The arrows on the left and right can be clicked to navigate over to all his other images. Each one reveals a title and description of the image. With another simple design, viewers can truly enjoy the pictures of Zephyr Stonefield in fullscreen!
