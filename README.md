## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visual Chronicles, Zephyr Stonefield's freelancing business, is his personal project capturing the magnificence he sees in the world. The portfolio design is deliberately simple, focusing solely on showcasing his photography. The color scheme—blue, a darker shade, and black—creates a monochromatic, elegant feel.

The layout features a clean design with a single section on the right, housing the business name, Zephyr's name, social links, and clickable thumbnail-like images. Upon entering the site, visitors are immediately introduced to a captivating first image. Users can expand the section to fullscreen, offering an immersive view of each picture.

Navigation is intuitive with left and right arrows, allowing seamless exploration of Zephyr's diverse collection. Each image click reveals a title and description, adding context to the visual experience. The result is a simple, elegant design that invites viewers to enjoy Zephyr Stonefield's photography in fullscreen glory.

## Optimizations

Zephyr enthusiastically featured the site across his business account, showcasing his portfolio. In terms of optimizations, a suggested enhancement is implementing a contact form directly on the page, providing easy accessibility for visitors. Another proposal involves organizing Zephyr's extensive image collection into curated sets with a navigation bar and dropdown menu for seamless exploration.

Additionally, incorporating an about section would add a personal touch, allowing Zephyr to share insights about himself for a more intimate connection with visitors. These optimizations aim to enhance user experience and engagement with Zephyr Stonefield's portfolio.

## Lessons Learned:

In this freelancing gig, collaborating with a top-class photographer like Zephyr Stonefield, I gained valuable insights into techniques for effectively showcasing images. Utilizing the 'srcset' attribute proved indispensable in determining the range of images required for various sections and device display widths. Making the site responsive involved crucial content decisions, providing insights into what elements suit specific screen sizes—whether it be a computer, tablet, or mobile phone. These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also broadened my understanding of thoughtful content design for optimal user experiences.
