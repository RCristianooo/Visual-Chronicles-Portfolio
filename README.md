# Visual Chronicles Portfolio 
Visual Chronicles is a Portfolio made for Zephyr Stonefield, a photographer from Florida. I created his website in order to assist him in showcasing some of his photography to some of his clients. It is also considered to be center for anyone interesting in his work as well as a way to get in touch with Zephyr.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visual Chronicles is the name of his freelancing business. As the single owner of Visual Chronicles, he sees his business as a project of his own. Taking pictures wherever he goes, often what he views to be magnificent in his own eyes. With photography being the center of his freelancing, his portfolio should be showing the images he has taken and nothing else. Therefore, Zephyr had a simple design in mind. He wanted a simple monochromatic colorway of blue. After a few suggestions, we went foward with a blue, a darker shade of blue, and black. He then only wanted a single section on the right that included the name of business, his name, social links, and finally many of his images. According to his instructions, the images in that section needed to be "smaller and clickable as if they were thumbnails on YouTube". The premise of his portfolio should be his pictures, therefore, when entered into the site, a person is introduced to his first image as ultimate showcasing. There is also an option to X out the section to enter fullscreen to his picture. The arrows on the left and right can be clicked to navigate over to all his other images. Each one reveals a title and description of the image. With another simple design, viewers can truly enjoy the pictures of Zephyr Stonefield in fullscreen!

## Optimizations

Zephyr was very glad about the outcome of the product. He was thrilled enough to featured his site all through his business account for any of his followers to see. While the site does shine, I believe it can shine even further if there was a chance of implementing a form below his page. I think people should have accessibility to contact him without going through Twitter, Instagram, or Email. Another optimization I could have made would be to ask for all his images to gather and turn into collections. To access these collections I would provide a navigation bar and a dropdown menu to view everything Zephyr has taken photos of. Finally, an about section where Zephyr has a chance to talk about himself. A side that Zephyr can share so that people can personally view.

## Lessons Learned:

With the second freelancing gig to be with a top-class photographer, I have learned about several techniques to utilize and showcase the images that Zephyr has taken. Srcset attributes were so useful to determine the several different images needed in both sections and device display width. The content decisions in making the site responsive also gave me ideas on what belongs on a particular screen size. Common sizes such as computer, tablet, or a mobile phone so to speak.

## Examples:
